# AIM
Data Collection and Cleaning: The project began by sourcing road accident data from reputable online repositories. Rigorous data cleaning techniques were applied to address inconsistencies, including the 'fatal' and 'fetal' intermix issue within a column.

Calendar Table: A 'calendar' table was meticulously constructed to facilitate time-based analysis. This table includes columns for date, month, and year, enabling smooth segmentation and comparison of accident data.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Essential KPIs were devised to quantify accident statistics for the year 2022. These KPIs encompass:

* Year 2022 casualties

* Year 2022 total accidents

* Year 2022 fatal casualties

* Year 2022 serious casualties

* Year 2022 slight casualties

Additionally, each KPI is supplemented with the percentage increase or decrease in casualties compared to the previous year, providing a dynamic perspective on accident trends.
